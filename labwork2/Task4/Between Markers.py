"""You are given a string and two markers (the initial and final). You have to
find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few
important conditions:
The initial and final markers are always different.
If there is no initial marker then the beginning should be considered as the
beginning of a string.
If there is no final marker then the ending should be considered as the ending
of a string.
If the initial and final markers are missing then simply return the whole
string.
If the final marker is standing in front of the initial one then return an
empty string.
Input: Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments
are the initial and final markers.
Output: A string."""
