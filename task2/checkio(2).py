        returns a corrected sentence which starts with a capital letter

        For the input of your function will be given one sentence. You have to return its fixed copy in a way so itâ€™s always starts with a capital letter and ends with a dot.

Pay attention to the fact that not all of the fixes is necessary. If a sentence already ends with a dot then adding another one will be a mistake.

Input:  A string.

Output:  A string.
